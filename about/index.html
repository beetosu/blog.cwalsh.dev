                <h3>Who?</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is <b>Colin Walsh</b>! I am a software engineer by trade, working mostly on web stuff for a mid-sized tech company.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently live in the Washington DC area (which used to not be a depressing thing to tell people), but I was born and raised in the Upstate New York area.
                </p>

                <h3>What?</h3>
                <p>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
                <p>I'm being intentionally loose about *what* exactly I'll write here. Essays? Tutorials? Fiction?? Who's to say.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>When?</h3>
                <p>Idk, whenever I remember to write something. Ping me if I go too long without writing something.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Where?</h3>
                <p>On the net babyyyyyyyyyyy</p>
                <p>I may cross post these articles at some point, but for now at least they only live here.</p>

                <h3>Why?</h3>
                <p>There are a couple of esoteric reasons why I started this blog:</p>
                <h4>Getting my HTML/writing reps in</h4>
                <p>
                    I spend a lot of time working on web stuff in my daily life, but I genuinely enjoy learning more about programming outside of the confines of the flashy frameworks everything is needlessly built on.
                    I want this to be a place where I really experiment with all of the weird stuff the HTML/CSS/JS is capable of. The thing I'm trying to find here is a way of writing that is unique to the web.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I want to also spend more time writing in general! I have gotten out of practice and want a outlet where I can just throw out small tidbits.
                </p>
                <h4>This is what the internet should be</h4>
                <p>
                    The more time passes, the crankier I get about the current state of the internet. Social media sucks, search engines suck. In the immortal words of Fred Durst:
                </p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "Everything is fucked, everybody sucks"
                    </blockquote>

                </figure>
                <p>
                    In my perfect world, bloggers are a thing again. Information is disseminated through weird, unorganized outlets instead of soulless, algorithmic content farms.
                    The internet should facilitate human interactions, not replace them.
